In order to compile the program  you must ensure that you are in the OSU server OS1. The command to enter the os1 server is through the following command
>>ssh os1.engr.oregonstate.edu
Then enter your ONID password

Then to comile the program enter the following in the terminal:
>>make clean
>>make

There will be some error suggestions that appear. But these do not interfere with the actual program. The code will still run and do the execution we are required. Then to prompt the actual program command the following:
>> smallsh

Then program should run. While the program used multiple files, the makefile runs them all as necessary. As there it runs the gcc command.
